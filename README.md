# Alchemy

Alchemy is a speed-dating application, designed to match users quickly without emphasizing on physical appearances.

This android application, allows users to create and host live events where they get to chat and interact
with as other users of their prefered gender. At the end of each event, the host can then choose one user which 
they think they have the most chemistry with and start chatting with them from there.

This application uses Firebase as its database, and android studio Java for both the front-end and back-end.
